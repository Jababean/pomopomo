Browser tab space is invaluable when studying, and shouldn't be cluttered by studying tools. Gala tucks away into the browser's task bar, saving space while still providing a fully functional timer. The extension by default follows the following format, and also includes complete customizability for the user.
> Four **25 minute** study sessions with **5 minute** short breaks inbetween followed by one **15 minute** long break afterwards.
