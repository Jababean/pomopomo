Browser tab space is invaluable when studying, and shouldn't be cluttered by studying tools. Podoro tucks away into the browser's task bar, saving space while still providing a fully functional timer. The extension by default follows the conventional pomodoro technique:
> Four **25 minute** pomodoro sessions with **5 minute** short breaks inbetween followed by one **15 minute** long break afterwards.

However, you can freely adjust the formula to suit any need.
